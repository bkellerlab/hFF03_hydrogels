This is a ropository for the force field of the hydrogel hFF03 with chromophore and possible glycan additions
It mainly exists to act as a code repository for the paper: How chromophore labels shape the structure and dynamics of a peptide hydrogel (Currently in Prerelease)

In this repository you can finde:
1. A modified Amber99-SB-ILDN forcefield for GROMACS that contains the ortho and para aminobenzoic acid as a residue type as well as linker and basic GLYCAN paramters for a K17 modification (Currently Unpublished)
2. Julia Code for Analysing persistence length and self assembly for hFF03 and its variant. 
3. Julia Code for a spatially resolved self diffusion coefficient of water around the hFF03 coiled-coil
3. Julia Code for to create the plots used in the Paper. Contains matplotlib over pygui.
4. Example files for the starting configurations and necessary mdp and topology files used in the Paper. Also contains short example trajectories that work 

While the codes have some documentation it is reletivly sparse. I tried to name all variables and function in a sensible way and hopefully selfexplanatory
